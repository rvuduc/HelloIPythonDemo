\section{Introduction}
History shows Galileo to be much more than an
astronomical hero, though. His clear and careful record keeping and
publication style not only let Galileo understand the Solar System, it
continues to let \emph{anyone} understand \emph{how} Galileo did it.
Galileo's notes directly integrated his \textbf{data} (drawings of
Jupiter and its moons), key \textbf{metadata} (timing of each
observation, weather, telescope properties), and \textbf{text}
(descriptions of methods, analysis, and conclusions). Critically, when
Galileo included the information from those notes in \emph{Siderius
Nuncius} \cite{galilei}, this integration of text, data and metadata was
preserved, as shown in Figure 1. Galileo's work advanced the
"Scientific Revolution,'' and his approach to observation and analysis
contributed significantly to the shaping of today's modern "Scientific
Method'' \cite{galilei1618assayer,galilei1957discoveries}.
