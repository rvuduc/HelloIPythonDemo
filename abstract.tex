This is an example article showing Authorea's new \textbf{iPython integration} features. Take a look at the figures in this paper. When you hover on a figure, a \textbf{"Launch Ipython"} button should appear. Click it and you'll be spinning a virtual machine which takes all analysis (iPython notebooks, makefiles, etc) and data behind that plot and runs it for you to play with. Enjoy!
